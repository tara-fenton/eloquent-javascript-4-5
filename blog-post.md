Summarize the week and write about any of the following:
 - your strengths
 - what could have gone better this week
 - what you think you can do better next week
 - what lab was challenging and why
 - a moment of clarity you had after struggling with a concept
 - a pair programming experience with a classmate

Think critically and think reflectively about what happened this week. Be honest with yourself! If you had a rough time thinking about the javascript we learned about, or if you didn't understand a problem in one of the homeworks, talk about it!


 - your strengths

Javascript is definitely a language I am very comfortable with the basics and most concepts. Assignments were reviews for me.

 - what could have gone better this week

I could have said something to my teachers before Friday when I was feeling anxiety about the material for the course being too basic for my past experience

 - what you think you can do better next week

I can make sure I am going beyond the material in class and ask for extra work if I donâ€™t feel the work is challenging enough

 - what lab was challenging and why

The filter lab was challenging, it is a tough concept to grasp for beginners. It was hard to brainstorm with partner since the concept was so new to him.

 - a moment of clarity you had after struggling with a concept

When given the added assignment to the fizzbuzz exercise to make it shorter. I was able to use the ternary expression and that technique never made sense to me before.

 - a pair programming experience with a classmate

Regardless of knowledge level, working with another person to solve a problem is more efficient. I am getting practice explaining the concepts I know and building with the partner to finish the task
