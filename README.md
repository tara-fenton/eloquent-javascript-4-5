# Weekend One Homework

## Retrospective Blog Post

The weekend is a great time to process and reflect on your thoughts and experiences here. Write a blog post about your first week experience.

Summarize the week and write about any of the following:
 - your strengths
 - what could have gone better this week
 - what you think you can do better next week
 - what lab was challenging and why
 - a moment of clarity you had after struggling with a concept
 - a pair programming experience with a classmate

Think critically and think reflectively about what happened this week. Be honest with yourself! If you had a rough time thinking about the javascript we learned about, or if you didn't understand a problem in one of the homeworks, talk about it!

Feel free to publish your blog post on a blogging website like [medium.com](https://medium.com).

If you don't want to share it on a public website, paste the content into a new file `blog-post.md` in your forked repository.
